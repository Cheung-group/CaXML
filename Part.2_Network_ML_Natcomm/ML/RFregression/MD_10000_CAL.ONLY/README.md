cal_iRESP_good.dat: 

This file should be used for the calcium charge and the indices for loop PDBs. 

# charges for calcium for those snapshots are relatively more physical (calcium is bound to the corresponding loop) 
# and protein charges are mostly good (checked on other data set containing charges for the whole system). 

structures/:
Directory for the PDB structures. There are still some bad structures. Use cal_iRESP_good.dat for selecting structures.
