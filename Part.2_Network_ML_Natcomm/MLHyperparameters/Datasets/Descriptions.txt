binarycontactmaps.csv | binary contacts (atoms from residues [ALA,ASN,ASP,GLN,GLU,GLY,ILE,LYS,PHE,PRO,SER,SOL,THR,TYR,VAL] within cutoff distance of CA) with cutoffs [2.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,5.0,5.5,6.0] angstroms.
  120 features
distances.csv | superset of binarycontactmaps.csv with 15 more features which contain the minimum distance in angstroms of an atom in each residue from CA or 6 angstroms if contact is absent.
