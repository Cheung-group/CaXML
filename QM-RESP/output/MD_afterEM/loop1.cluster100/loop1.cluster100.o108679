  Amber 10/11 i_RESP demo: 2 stage fit on 3 conformations with polarization 
 
convert the GAUSSIAN output for i-resp:
# atoms:   192 # esp: 31899
generating the input for i-resp stage 1:
there are a total of 192 atoms
3 water molecules
generating initial charge file:
A total of 192 atoms and 3 water.
