Deriving Ca2+ Charge in Varying Environment Using Machine Learning Methods

Part.1_Calcium_charges_JPC 
QM-derived charges for divalent calcium ions.

Note.1 A few basis sets and theories were tested.
Note.2 Two vdW radii were compared. (Ca1.0, Ca1.7)
Note.3 The Ca1.0_Extra are yet used for testing purpose.

QM input: directory QM-RESP/input, which would be the MD structures (and Gaussian input files from the md structures).
QM output: directory QM-RESP/output


Part.2_Network_ML_Natcomm
3. ML models and scripts: directory ML/.
