1. QM input will be uploaded to the directory QM-RESP/input, which would be the MD structures (and Gaussian input files from the md structures).
2. QM output will be uploaded by Prof. Cieplak, Jaebeom, and Pengzhi to the directory QM-RESP/output
3. ML models and scripts (most are yet preliminary) are in directory ML/.
