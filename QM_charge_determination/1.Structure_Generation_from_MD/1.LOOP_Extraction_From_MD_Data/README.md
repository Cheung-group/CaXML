PDB structures of the calcium binding loops with calcium ion and the water molecules were extracted
directly from the MD simulations of Ca/CaM in solution.  

The backbone heavy atoms from the precedent and proceeding amino acids are extracted as well as the ACE and NME caps. Necessary H atoms are added.

The extracted loop structures are feature renamed in the directory LOOP_STRUCTURES/.
